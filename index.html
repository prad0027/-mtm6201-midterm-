<h2>Founding Story</h2>
<p>
    <b>The Golden Spoon Bakery</b> had humble beginnings traced back to a small kitchen in a quaint village.
     It all started with the passion for baking passed down through generations in the Smithson family. 
     Martha Smithson, a talented baker known for her delectable pastries, dreamt of sharing her creations with the world.
In the late 1970s, Martha decided to turn her passion into a profession. 
With her lifelong savings and an unshakable belief in her recipes, she rented a small shop in the heart of the village and officially established "The Golden Spoon Bakery." 
The name came from Martha's cherished golden spoon, a family heirloom symbolizing her commitment to preserving the art of baking.
